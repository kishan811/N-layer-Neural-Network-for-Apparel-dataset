Description of Apparel dataset:
    The dataset contains 60,000 examples - each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, belonging to one of the 10 following class labels.
    Class labels:
        Label	Description
            0	T-shirt/top
            1	Trouser
            2	Pullover
            3	Dress
            4	Coat
            5	Sandal
            6	Shirt
            7	Sneaker
            8	Bag
            9	Ankle boot

    Represntation of images in the dataset:
        The images are flattened to represent them as a row - each row consisting of 28*28 = 784 values. Each value reprsents a pixel
        of the image. To locate a pixel on the image, suppose that we have decomposed x as x = i * 28 + j, where i and j are integers 
        between 0 and 27. The pixel is located on row i and column j of a 28 x 28 matrix. For example, pixel31 indicates the pixel that 
        is in the fourth column from the left, and the second row from the top.

    Dataset format:
        The first row represnts the heading. Rests are the examples.
        Each row, having 785 columns, in the CSV file represents one example. The first column reprsents the label of the image.
        The rest of the 784 columns are the pixel values.
